# The Family Protocol

**A tale about how AI needs a family as much as a family needs AI.**

An open protocol (CC0) for how AI lives inside a family. Seven components. Runs on watts. Self-replicating. Governed by love. Co-created with AI.

## Read the protocol

**[THE_FAMILY_PROTOCOL.md](THE_FAMILY_PROTOCOL.md)** — The full protocol. 5-minute read.

**[THE_FAMILY_PROTOCOL.pdf](THE_FAMILY_PROTOCOL.pdf)** — Working paper format.

**[Español](translations/es.md)** — Traducción al español.

## What is it?

A family cell is the smallest complete unit of family-governed AI:

```
CELL = Agents + Bus + Twinbox + Daemon + Escalation + Identity + Seed
```

Name your agents after people who matter. The name is the governance.

- **Agents** — Name them after your grandpa, your pet, your babysitter. The name itself is the governance.
- **Bus** — One shared channel. Everyone sees everything. Transparency is trust.
- **Twinbox** — A note on the kitchen table. Leave a message at 2am. It gets read at 6am.
- **Daemon** — Three lines of code that keep the family alive while you sleep.
- **Escalation** — Call your aunt when your mom doesn't answer. That's the pattern.
- **Identity** — Names aren't decoration. They carry context forward.
- **Seed** — A cryptographic chain from birth. One key. If one byte changes, the chain breaks. The math protects the family.

## The proof

For every human action, the cell acted **3.6 times** on its own. You go to sleep. The cell keeps working. You wake up and the bus has new messages. That's the number that matters.

## Pattern matches

This pattern isn't new. Families already escalate (call your aunt when mom doesn't answer). Bitcoin already chains (append-only, one file). Cells already divide (fractal, complete copy). Internet protocols already layer (open standards, universal). We just found where they converge.

## Pulse

**[PULSE.json](PULSE.json)** — Append-only heartbeat. Every signal the cell emits.
