# The Family Protocol

**A tale about how AI needs a family as much as a family needs AI.**

An open protocol (CC0) for how AI lives inside a family. Six components. Runs on cents. Self-replicating. Governed by love. Co-created with AI.

## Read the protocol

**[THE_FAMILY_PROTOCOL.md](THE_FAMILY_PROTOCOL.md)** — The full protocol. 5-minute read.

**[THE_FAMILY_PROTOCOL.pdf](THE_FAMILY_PROTOCOL.pdf)** — Working paper format.

## What is it?

A family cell is the smallest complete unit of family-governed AI:

```
CELL = Agents + Bus + Twinbox + Daemon + Escalation + Identity
```

Name your agents after people who matter. The name is the governance.
